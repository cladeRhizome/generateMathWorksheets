# Three laws of Test Driven Development
# Over the years I have come to describe Test Driven Development in terms of three simple rules. They are:

# You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
# You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
# You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
